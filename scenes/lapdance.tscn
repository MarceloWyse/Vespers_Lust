I can barely see your rack.", "Deckard: Nice, you have an awesome butt.", "Now sit on my lap and shake it.", "You approach him timidly, moving awkwardly, but soon start to get into the rhythm.", "As he promised, he hasn’t touched you a single time.

You can finally feel his member pulsating under his briefs.", "Vesper: Now, you’re gonna let me leave and take some blood with me, as agreed?", "Deckard: After this little show you’ve put up I’ll happily let you go and take a syringe with you.", "Deckard: If you’re feeling like visiting old Deckard again, you know where to find me.", "You come with money or be prepared to pay with that pretty body of yours, as promised, we’ll do whatever you’re comfortable with.", "Vesper: Okay, it’s a deal.", "He unlocks the door, and lets you leave with a full syringe in your pocket.
