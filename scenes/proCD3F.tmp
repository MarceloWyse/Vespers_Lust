", "Several days after their disappearance, the families were devastated to learn that most of their loved ones had been discovered lifeless in different locations throughout the town.", "The physicians performed exhaustive evaluations of the corpses; however, they could not account for the inexplicable absence of blood, as the corpses showed no signs of injuries or cuts.", "These last weeks, you have plunged yourself deep into this research.", "Fortunately, your supervisor has given you carte blanche to investigate.", "You’ve done your homework and left no stone unturned, but the police weren’t slacking in this case either.", "The reason you strongly believe is that the first victim to disappear was Helena Bergson.", "Who happens to be the former mayor's daughter.

How did she manage to disappear into thin air without leaving any trace? Is the girls' disappearance linked to hers?", "Ultimately, the police were forced to file Helena's case as a missing person rather than a kidnapping, ", "and her family hasn't shown any interest in offering a reward for information concerning her whereabouts.", "But, something tells you to keep investigating, keep asking around, someone must have seen her.", "You know from experience that a tall, good-looking, blond woman is going to call attention.", "Instead of guessing where she could be now, you spent your time retracing her steps and asking around. ", "By all accounts, Helena was smart, funny, and beautiful, people gathered around her, and it was nearly impossible to track her movements because she was everywhere and talked to everyone.", "So you forced yourself to go undercover to the same parties.", "You imagined that young people would be more open to sharing information with a young girl like yourself than with the police.", "You even asked Helena's family to visit her bedroom at the newspaper’s behest.", "As you had expected, her mom was cold and distant.
