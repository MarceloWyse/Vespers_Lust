It’s either this or death.", "I’m not even a person, I’m a walking corpse. Why should I feel ashamed, I need the money, and I need to feed, now. This could easily become my hunting ground, without the risk of getting caught. ", "I just have to be rational and think smart. The best way to do this is to play the part. A fairly young girl like me, in this place, nobody would suspect if I lured men into the shadows. ", "It’s not prostitution, per se, it’s strategy. ", "When I was interviewing these girls they all told me I could make a fortune here with my looks…. most of them were sad, but a few actually liked this job, I shouldn’t be so judgemental.", "At least it’s a fair trade, my body for their blood and money.
